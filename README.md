### User stories

```
As a User
So that I can easily locate pages I want to find again
I want to be shown a list of bookmarks

As a User
So that I can remember new pages that I find interesting

##  Database setup instructions
We used PostgreSQL to create a database called Bookmark_Manager, which contained a table called "bookmarks".

1) `brew install PostgreSQL`

2) `ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents`

3) `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist`

4) Run: `psql PostgreSQL`

5) Then, create the database in psql using:
`CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;`

6) Connect to the database using:
`\c bookmark_manager`

7) Run the query in the file, *01_create_bookmarks_table.sql*
